> **Important Note**
> This code is only to demonstrate my skills in job interviews, but hopefully, in the future there will be a production ready version of this code.

## About
This is the backend part of Thomsi, which is written in C# with .NET 6.0 and ASP.NET Core.
The backend part is depending on two other libraries **[Thomsi_Core](https://github.com/Thomashh2k/Thomsi_Core) (Contains bussiness logic) [Database](https://github.com/Thomashh2k/Thomsi_DB) (Code-First Postgres Database)**

### Unit Testing
